I'll implement the component from the task specification. Please follow these steps:

1. First, I'll read the task specification carefully to understand the requirements
2. I'll plan the implementation, focusing on:
   - Clear class hierarchies with proper inheritance
   - Interface definitions with type annotations
   - Dependency injection patterns
   - Error handling and logging
   - Testability and modularity

3. I'll implement the code with:
   - Comprehensive docstrings for all classes and methods
   - Proper type annotations
   - Clean, modular code that follows PEP 8
   - No methods longer than 50 lines
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Proper error handling

4. I'll verify the implementation against the requirements

Let me analyze task specification $ARGUMENTS and implement it.
