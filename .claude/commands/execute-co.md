# Execute BASE Change Order

Implement a feature using using the Change Order (CO) file.

## Change Order File: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Process

1. **Load Change Order**
   - Read the specified Change Order file
   - Understand all context and requirements
   - Follow all instructions in the Change Order and extend the research if needed
   - Ensure you have all needed context to implement the Change Order fully
   - Do more web searches and codebase exploration as needed

2. **Create Implementation Branch**
   - Create a new feature branch for this Change Order implementation
   - Use descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/co-video-extraction-fix`)
   - Switch to the new branch before beginning implementation
   - **NEVER implement directly on main branch**

3. **ULTRATHINK**
   - Think hard before you execute the plan. Create a comprehensive plan addressing all requirements.
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps using your todos tools.
   - Use the TodoWrite tool to create and track your implementation plan.
   - Identify implementation patterns from existing code to follow.

4. **Execute the plan**
   - Execute the Change Order on the feature branch
   - Implement all the code
   - Make regular commits with clear messages

5. **Validate**
   - Run each validation command
   - Fix any failures
   - Re-run until all pass
   - Ensure all tests pass completely

6. **Complete and Submit**
   - Ensure all checklist items done
   - Run final validation suite
   - Read the Change Order again to ensure you have implemented everything
   - Create a Pull Request to merge into main branch
   - **NEVER automatically merge into main**
   - Include comprehensive testing results in PR description

7. **Reference the Change Order**
   - You can always reference the Change Order again if needed

Note: If validation fails, use error patterns in Change Order to fix and retry.
