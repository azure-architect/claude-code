I'll create comprehensive tests for the component. I'll follow these steps:

1. Analyze the component to understand its functionality and interfaces
2. Create a test plan covering:
   - Unit tests for each method and function
   - Edge cases and error conditions
   - Mock dependencies to isolate the component being tested
   - Parametrized tests for different input scenarios
   
3. Implement pytest test cases with:
   - Proper test fixture setup
   - Clear test case descriptions
   - Assertions that validate expected behavior
   - Test coverage for at least 90% of the code

4. Include performance tests where appropriate

Let me create tests for component $ARGUMENTS.
